# Graylog extractors for Barracuda CloudGen Firewall and Control Center
Since I couldn't find any existing working extractors for Barracuda, I decided to make them myself and share them with everyone. :)

I would consider this still "work in progress", but the extractors published here suffice for our environment.
Feel free to use this as a base for your own implementation.
